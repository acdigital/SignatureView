It is based on Apple Inc's example code.\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE IT\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nYou must add the OpenGLES.framework and QuartzCore.framework to the Xcode project. Implement this repository as git sub module to your iOS project.\r\n\r\nLook at https://github.com/jcmontiel/SignatureViewExample.git for an example of how to implement.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE\r\n-------\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how to implement the SignatureViewController and it's signature view into your own viewControllers.\r\n\r\nself.signature is a UIView reference to an IBOutlet (from xib), that is the placeholder for the signature view\r\n\r\nself.signatureViewController will be instantiated in your viewDidLoad to control the signatureView, then the signatureViewController.view replaces the self.signature view and is put under control of your viewController.\r\n\r\n\t//\r\n\t- (void)viewDidLoad\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t[super viewDidLoad];\r\n  \r\n\t\tself.signatureController = [[[SignatureViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@\"SignatureView\" bundle:nil] autorelease];\r\n\t\tself.signatureController.delegate = self;\r\n  \r\n\t\tself.signatureController.view.frame = self.signatureView.frame;\r\n\t\t[self.view insertSubview:self.signatureController.view belowSubview:self.signatureView];\r\n\t\t[self.signatureView removeFromSuperview];\r\n\t\tself.signatureView = self.signatureController.view;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n\t- (void) signatureViewController:(SignatureViewController *)viewController didSign:(NSData *)signature;\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tNSData *thisSignature = signature;\r\n\t\t// \r\n\t\t// Do something with thisSignature, like save it to a file or a database as binary data.\r\n\t\t//\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 by Em Sevn, LLC\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
