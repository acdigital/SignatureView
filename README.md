This is a simple iOS signature view and controller to capture a PNG image from a finger drawn signature. It is based on one of Apple Inc's example code.

HOW TO USE IT
-------------

This repository has two branches; master and SampleProject. The master branch is intended to be used as a git submodule in your project and only contains the necessary components. The SampleProject branch is, simply put, a sample implementation and should not be used as a git submodule, but cloned as a standalone project.

You must add the OpenGLES.framework and QuartzCore.framework to the Xcode project.

EXAMPLE
-------

Here is an example of how to implement the SignatureViewController and it's signature view into your own viewControllers

self.signature is a UIView reference to an IBOutlet (from xib), that is the placeholder for the signature view to be placed into

self.signatureViewController will be instantiated in your viewDidLoad
  
(void)viewDidLoad
{
	[super viewDidLoad];
  
	// â€¦

	self.signatureController = [[[SignatureViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"SignatureView" bundle:nil] autorelease];
	self.signatureController.delegate = self;
  
	self.signatureController.view.frame = self.signatureView.frame;
	[self.view insertSubview:self.signatureController.view belowSubview:self.signatureView];
	[self.signatureView removeFromSuperview];
	self.signatureView = self.signatureController.view;
}


(void) signatureViewController:(SignatureViewController *)viewController didSign:(NSData *)signature;
{
	NSData *thisSignature = signature;
	// 
	// Do something with thisSignature, like save it to a file or a database as binary data.
	//
}
